GoogolplexCoin - The Coin Bigger Than The Universe
==================================================

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT RUN. IT IS FORKED FROM HIROCOIN AS A BASE AND COULD CAUSE ISSUES.

The Problem
-----------

We are attempting to create a coin that has a base amount of 10 to the power 10 to the power 100.
This exceeds current 64 bit computing, and therefore cannot run.

Without the advent of nBit computing this project cannot come to fruition.

In addition to this as 1 Googolplex accounts for more atoms on the known universe, the space required to store it is unfeasable.

The Solution
------------

To recruit a team a highly skilled mathematicians to work around the limits of modern computing and continue this project with hard-forks each time a new computing architecture is released.
